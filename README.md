## üöÄ Getting Started

To get the application up and running locally, follow the setup outline below:

### üîÅ 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository to your local development environment.

### üõ† 2. Set Up Your Development Stack

Ensure that you have the following software installed and configured:

- Apache2 web server (e.g., via XAMPP, LAMP, or WAMP)
- PHP (version 8.1+ recommended)
- MySQL or MariaDB

### üóÑ 3. Create the Database

Log into your local MySQL database and create a new database named: **task_manager**


Once the database is created, import the `task_manager.sql` file (sql dumpfile) provided in the root of the project. This SQL file will automatically create the necessary tables (`users`, `tasks`) and populate them with sample users and tasks for testing.

### üîê 4. Configure Database Connection

In the file located at: `includes/db.php` update the database connection credentials (`host`, `user`, `password`, `db`) to match your local environment settings. This allows the application to communicate with your MySQL database.

### üîë 5. Login Credentials

The SQL dump file includes four sample users, including two admins and two regular users. Use any of their credentials (emails and passwords) to log into the application and test its features. Inspect `task_manager.sql` to view the specific emails and default passwords.
