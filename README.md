## üöÄ Getting Started

To get the application up and running locally, follow the setup outline below:

### üîÅ 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository to your local development environment.

### üõ† 2. Set Up Your Development Stack

Ensure that you have the following software installed and configured:

- Apache2 web server (e.g., via XAMPP, LAMP, or WAMP)
- PHP (version 8.1+ recommended)
- MySQL or MariaDB

### üóÑ 3. Create the Database

Log into your local MySQL database and create a new database named: **task_manager**


Once the database is created, import the `task_manager.sql` file (sql dumpfile) provided in the root of the project. This SQL file will automatically create the necessary tables (`users`, `tasks`) and populate them with sample users and tasks for testing.

### üîê 4. Configure Database Connection

In the file located at: `includes/db.php` update the database connection credentials (`host`, `user`, `password`, `db`) to match your local environment settings. This allows the application to communicate with your MySQL database.

### üîë 5. Login Credentials

You have **two options** for accessing the application:

#### ‚úÖ Option 1: Create Your Own Account

You can register a new user through the built-in **Sign Up** page:

- Go to the `/signup.php` page on your local or deployed version.
- Fill in the required details: **Username**, **Email**, **Password**, and select your **Role**.
- If you choose **Admin**, you‚Äôll be able to assign tasks to yourself or others.
- If you choose **User**, you‚Äôll only see and manage tasks assigned to you.

This is the recommended option if you want to simulate a fresh user flow.

---

#### üß™ Option 2: Use the Sample Accounts from the SQL Dump

The `task_manager.sql` file includes **four sample users**:
- **2 Admins** and **2 Users**, each with sample credentials.
- You can use these to log in and test the full functionality right away.

> üîç Check the `task_manager.sql` file directly to find the sample **emails** and default **passwords** for login.

---


## 6. üß™ Run the Application

With everything set up, launch your preferred browser and visit: `http://localhost/your-folder-path-being-served/index.php`. You should be greeted by the login page and be able to access the dashboard after logging in.
